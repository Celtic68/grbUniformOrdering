                <h2>Joe Alexander's Journey to Re-Entering IT</h2>
                <div class="article-info">Posted on <time datetime="2019-03-03">March 3rd</time> by <a href="#" rel="author">Joe Alexander</a></div>

                <p>I completed the Mainframe degree program at Madison College in December of 1997. At that point, I had been working for Great Lakes Higher
                    Education for nine months as an Intern and Programmer Trainee. Over the course of the next seven years, I worked my way up to a Project
                    Leader position and was part of several large intiatives. In 2004, I decided to resign and become a stay at home dad. For 15 years, I
                    held down the fort at home while my wife worked her way to the position of COO at Great Lakes. During that time, I also built my own
                    home theater room, home brewing area and coached several teams for my children.</p>

                <p>In 2018, we decided the time was right for me to go back to work. I loved working in IT so it was an easy decision to go back to school
                    to reinvent myself as a modern IT professional. To that end, I decided to pursue both the Web Development and Mobile App degree programs
                    and I am set to graduate from both programs in December of 2019.</p>
