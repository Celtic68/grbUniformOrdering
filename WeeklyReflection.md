# GRB Uniform Ordering
## Weekly Reflection

### Week 1 – 9/1/19 through 9/8/19
#### Tasks Completed:
* Decided on a Project Concept
* Created the Problem Statement
* Documented the User Stories
* Rough Version of Project Plan
* Created the Time Log
* Created the Visual Application Screen Flow Diagram
* Started the Text Application Screen Flow document

I have been thinking about this project for over a year as the process has become unwieldy at the complex.  Enterprise 
Java seemed like the perfect opportunity to implement the project as a whole as it is the first class to really bring 
all the pieces of building an application together. The initial piece that will likely take the most time is laying out 
a project plan for the semester…

I decided to use Balsamiq to do the screen design mockups – it seemed the easiest to get in and use right away without a
lot of figuring out to use it.  It was pretty intuitive.\

As far as services this application might consume, I have not really researched that portion. The application design 
seems straightforward so I will likely need to determine how to meet the project criteria of adding these types of 
services.

#### Potential API / Service ideas:
* Could I add map functionality for the travel day?
* What about closest amenities? Can I do in application adds to such places as Subway, etc?
* Does the uniform ordering place have an API to submit a mass order? Have to find out who they use for uniforms…
* How about captcha?

### Week 2 – 9/9/19 through 9/15/19
#### Tasks Completed:
* Finished the Text Application Screen Flow document
* Created the initial project structure in IntelliJ and got it pushed to GitHub
I started the week by finishing off the text document for the screen flow – this is a really helpful document as it 
provides more of a detailed flow than the visual in my opinion.

I got into Activity 4 in week 2, and it seemed like the perfect time to get all my documents added to the repository.
