# GRB Uniform Ordering
## Weekly Reflection

### Week 1 – 9/1/19 through 9/8/19
#### Tasks Completed:
* Decided on a Project Concept
* Created the Problem Statement
* Documented the User Stories
* Rough Version of Project Plan
* Created the Time Log
* Created the Visual Application Screen Flow Diagram
* Started the Text Application Screen Flow document

I have been thinking about this project for over a year as the process has become unwieldy at the complex.  Enterprise 
Java seemed like the perfect opportunity to implement the project as a whole as it is the first class to really bring 
all the pieces of building an application together. The initial piece that will likely take the most time is laying out 
a project plan for the semester…

I decided to use Balsamiq to do the screen design mockups – it seemed the easiest to get in and use right away without a
lot of figuring out to use it.  It was pretty intuitive.\

As far as services this application might consume, I have not really researched that portion. The application design 
seems straightforward so I will likely need to determine how to meet the project criteria of adding these types of 
services.

#### Potential API / Service ideas:
* Could I add map functionality for the travel day?
* What about closest amenities? Can I do in application adds to such places as Subway, etc?
* Does the uniform ordering place have an API to submit a mass order? Have to find out who they use for uniforms…
* How about captcha?

### Week 2 – 9/9/19 through 9/15/19
#### Tasks Completed:
* Finished the Text Application Screen Flow document
* Created the initial project structure in IntelliJ and got it pushed to GitHub
* Transformed all the documents to markdown language and pushed them all to Github

I started the week by finishing off the text document for the screen flow – this is a really helpful document as it 
provides more of a detailed flow than the visual in my opinion.

I got into Activity 4 in week 2, and it seemed like the perfect time to get all my documents added to the repository.
The readMe, Time Log and Weekly Reflection have all been changed to markdown files and push to the remote repository.
For good measure, I also changed and pushed all the remaining design documents as well and signed up for a final 
presentation slot in week 16.

Paula suggested a website https://www.programmableweb.com to search for APIs.  She also suggested maybe a sports ticker,
or an API that validates a zip code for an address.

### Week 3 – 9/16/19 through 9/22/19
#### Tasks Completed:

* Made changes to Project Plan to push database work back to allow for Hibernate training

Long week last week with other classes, so I did not get as far ahead as I had hoped. This week will likely be a EJ
focus week.

I updated the Project Plan to push database stuff later and move some jsp work earlier to allow for us to get into
Hibernate concepts to reduce the amount of project refactoring.
